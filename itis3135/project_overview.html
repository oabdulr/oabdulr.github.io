            <h3><strong>Project Overview</strong></h3>
            <div class="project_overview section-content">
                <p><strong>Application Description:</strong> This project involves creating a web application named "AppointEase" designed to streamline the appointment scheduling process for small service-based businesses and their clients. It will provide a user-friendly interface for customers to view available services and book appointments online, and an administrative interface for the business owner/staff to manage schedules, services, and client information.</p>
                <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The primary purpose of AppointEase is to replace manual or phone-based appointment systems with an efficient, accessible, and automated online solution. This aims to reduce administrative overhead for the business, minimize booking errors, improve customer convenience by allowing 24/7 booking, and provide a clear overview of scheduled appointments.</p>
                <p><strong>Intended Users:</strong> There are two main groups of users:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Clients/Customers:</strong> Individuals seeking to book services offered by the business. They need an easy way to see service details, check availability, and schedule appointments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Business Owner/Staff (Administrators):</strong> Individuals responsible for managing the business's services, schedule availability, viewing booked appointments, and potentially managing basic client information.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Content Overview:</strong> The website will feature a public-facing section including a homepage, service listings, a booking interface, and a contact page. It will also include a password-protected administrative section for managing appointments and settings.</p>

            <div class="sitemap section-content">
                <p>The site map outlines the structure of the website, showing the different pages and the hierarchical relationship between them.

                </ul>
                 <p>A consistent navigation bar will allow single-click access to Home, Services, Booking, and Contact. Access to the Admin page might be via a separate login link, perhaps in the footer or header.</p>

            <h3><strong>Dynamic Functionality on the website</strong></h3>
            <div class="dynamic-functionality section-content">
                <p>The website will incorporate JavaScript and PHP to enhance user experience and provide interactive features:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Interactive Booking Form (booking.html):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> A multi-step or dynamic form for selecting services, date, and time, followed by user information input.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A <strong>Date picker</strong> will be used for easy and intuitive date selection.</li>
                                    <li>Available time slots will be dynamically loaded based on the selected date (and potentially service), likely using <strong>PHP and Lite SQL</strong> to query available slots without reloading the page.</li>
                                    <li>Client-side form <strong>validation</strong> using JavaScript will check for required fields, email format, etc., before submission, providing immediate feedback to the user.</li>
                                    <li>Form submission might use <strong>PHP and Lite SQL DB</strong> to send the booking data to the server and display a success or error message without a full page refresh, enhancing the user experience.</li>
                                 </ul>
                             </li>
                            <li><strong>Why:</strong> Makes the booking process smooth, intuitive, and efficient. Reduces user error and provides instant feedback.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example URLs:</strong> <a href="https://calendly.com/" target="_blank">Calendly</a> (complex scheduling), many online booking systems for salons, doctors, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                     <li>
                        <strong>Admin Appointment Management (admin.html):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> Displaying the list or calendar of appointments. <strong>PHP and Lite SQL</strong> could be used to:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Fetch and display appointments dynamically.</li>
                                    <li>Allow admins to cancel or modify appointment statuses without full page reloads.</li>
                                    <li>Potentially filter or sort appointments based on date or status.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Why:</strong> Provides administrators with a responsive and efficient interface for managing the schedule.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example URLs:</strong> Features found in many CMS dashboards (like WordPress post management) or project management tools (like Trello card updates).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Contact Form Submission (contact.html):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> Use JavaScript for client-side <strong>validation</strong>. Implement <strong>PHP and Lite SQl</strong> submission to send the form data and display a "Message Sent!" or error notification directly on the page without navigating away.</li>
                            <li><strong>Why:</strong> Improves user experience by providing immediate feedback without disrupting their place on the site.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example URLs:</strong> Most modern website contact forms utilize this pattern.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                     <li>
                        <strong>Consistent Header/Footer Loading:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> The provided `html_include.js` script likely uses JavaScript to load `components/header.html` and `components/footer.html` into each page.</li>
                            <li><strong>Why:</strong> Ensures consistency across all pages and makes updates easier (only need to edit the component files).</li>
                            <li><strong>Example URLs:</strong> This is a common development pattern, often handled by frameworks or simple custom scripts like the one provided.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
