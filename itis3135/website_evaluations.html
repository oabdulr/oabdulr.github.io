            <div style = "display: flex;"> 
                <div style="padding-right: 50%">
                    <h3 style="text-align: center; width: 300px;"><a href="https://arngren.net/">Bad Site</a></h3>
                    <p>This site falls heavily under the C.R.A.P design, its very messy, unaligned and everything is stuck together, I'd rate this site a 3/10. It has a charm to it that makes it unique and weirdly plesent at the same time</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Contrast</b> - The pages contrast isnt too awful, there are some moments when the images cover things completely.</li>
                        <li><b>Repetition</b> - This page has almost no repetition everything is random and all over the place, the borders are random and the font and location are as well</li>
                        <li><b>Alignment</b> - The worst offender of them all, nothing is in order and aligned</li>
                        <li><b>Proximity</b> - Nothing has space inbetween, its all stuck together</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3 style="text-align: center; width: 300px;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Good Site</a></h3>
                    <p>This site follows a majority of the C.R.A.P design concepts, it executes them pretty well and keeps retained user base.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Contrast</b> - The pages contrast is clean  and simple, everything is easy to reader and understand.</li>
                        <li><b>Repetition</b> - The iconic blue of Amazon is used often as well as their way of sorting items in small cubicals.</li>
                        <li><b>Alignment</b> - Everything is properly aligned and is plesent to the eyes.</li>
                        <li><b>Proximity</b> - Items are grouped with small gaps together then seperated by large gaps which flows and looks good.</li>
                    </ul>
